# Simple Task Tracker

A modern task tracking application built with TypeScript that demonstrates Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Set due dates and priority levels
- Mark tasks as complete
- View task details and history
- Filter and sort tasks
- Responsive design for all devices

## HCI Principles Implemented

The application implements the following HCI principles:

1. **Consistency** - Uniform design elements, colors, and behavior across all pages
2. **Visibility of system status** - Clear indicators for tasks that are due soon, overdue, or completed
3. **User control and freedom** - Easy navigation, undo options, and confirmation dialogs
4. **Error prevention** - Form validation and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
5. **Recognition rather than recall** - Visual cues and recognizable icons for priority levels and task status
6. **Flexibility and efficiency of use** - Keyboard shortcuts and filters for advanced users
7. **Aesthetic and minimalist design** - Clean interface with intentional use of white space
8. **Help and documentation** - Contextual help tooltips and keyboard shortcut guides
